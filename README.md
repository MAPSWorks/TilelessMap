#### This info is dated, new will come. ####

The project has had some progress.
I have it working on Android and Linux.


This is a project in a very early stage

Licensce GPL v2

## To compile ##

I have only compiled it on Linux, but it should be no problem compiling at other platforms.

You will need the gcc compiler. Easiest way to get the common build tools in Debian and it's children is to install build-essential

apt-get install build-essential

Dependencies:
SDL2
glew

So on Debian system install dependencies with:

apt-get install libglew1.10 libsdl2-dev

Building:
make

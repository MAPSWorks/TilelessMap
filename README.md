## To compile ##

I will come with more info

I have only compiled it on Linux, but it should be no problem compiling at other platforms.

You will need the gcc compiler. Easiest way to get the common build tools in Debian and it's children is to install build-essential

apt-get install build-essential

Dependencies:
SDL2
glew
freetype

So on Debian system install dependencies with:

apt-get install libglew1.10 libsdl2-dev

Building:
make

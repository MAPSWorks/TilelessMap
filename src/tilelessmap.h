/*************** UI-tools *******************/

/* This is a work in progress but the goal is this:
 * 
 * All this shall be done between TLM_init and TLM_start
 * 
 * There are 3 ways to get buttons and menues:
 * 1)   Init TilelessMap native UI with default controls. 
 *      Gives a simple Layers button and some other generic
 *      buttons and menues as they get developed
 * 2)   Define custom menues and buttons with TilelessMaps UI-tools defined below
 * 3)   Create UI outside of TilelessMap and just communicate with TilelessMap 
 *      to get and set values and states. With this approach the menues can for example be Android native. 
 */

 * CUSTOM approach inits no UI functionality at all
 * */

/*If we have choosen TILELESS_NATIVE approach we are done. There is nothing that can be customized
 * But if we choose TILELESS_CUSTOM we need the functions below to build the interface
 * You can copy and paste from UI.c to get started and customize from that*/

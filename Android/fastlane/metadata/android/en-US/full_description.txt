A mapclient that reads data from a local SQLite database and renders 
the map through openGL. 

The database that the app reads from can be anywhere on the phone, which means 
that the same data can be used across multiple apps. If you need to reinstall 
the app, the data will not be touched. That is good since you can handle many 
GB of data in the app. In the future there will hopefully be a separate app 
taking care of keeping your data up to date, which is a simple task since 
syncronization can be done based on timestamps of single geometries.

This project is still more of a "proof of concept". Any contributions to make 
it more complete and feature rich is welcome. Hopefully this can become a 
healthy community project. 

''''The maps''''
You can get maps from "ready to use" databases or you can pack your own.

A few maps that is "ready to use" can be downloded from
